## advanced reporter for memcached ##

Advanced Reporter is a stats tool for memcached which provides information about the most active clients and object keys for your memcached servers. It provides you with a more detailed understanding of:

  * What is being stored on your memcached servers
  * Placement of keys and how they are being used
  * Client behavior, for example, how it may impact client-side hashing etc.
  * On which servers where the most used keys are stored, which is useful for load balancing purposes

Advanced Reporter can also be used with [statsproxy for memcached](http://dev.gear6.com/downloads/statsproxy), which provides a buffered web view for memcached stats.
